About K-nearest neighbor? Read this [blog](http://kunuk.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/k-nearest-neighbor-in-2d-dimension-space).
The origin in the center is the red color. The pink colors are the nearest neighbors and are slightly larger in size.

K-nearest neighbor

Nearest neighbors by same type only. The origin is the red and the same type is the purples. 
The nearest neighbors are the purples and are slightly larger in size.
